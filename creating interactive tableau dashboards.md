## 4 W s of Good Dashboards

### WHO

#### The audience type determines 2 things:

1. Domain knowledge
2. Complexity of the visualization

* who is the audience
* what do they already know
* how much detail should be included
  * You
  * Your team
    * consider the visualization for explanations
    * simple chart types
    * understand the data
  * Your department
    * add more explanations and terminology
    * explain the data
  * Senior management
    * much higher level, more data from more sources
    * not as much detail
    * ability to drill down
    * explanations on terminology and data
  * Operational
    * real-time data
    * filters and interactions to drill down
  * General public
    * carefully explain the data and what's important
    * consider chart type and explanations

### WHERE

* where will the dashboard be viewed
* large or small screen
* print, mobile, desktop
* size of the dashboard
* how many elements can fit

#### Influencing Characteristics

* **Dashboard size**
* **Number of elements and layout**

#### Level of interaction

##### Desktop/ Laptop

* greatest freedom
* large amount of space
* lots of interaction
* filters, parameters, actions

##### Tablet/ Mobile

* smaller maximum size
* consider the orientation
* scrolling vs. single screen

##### Print/ TV Display

* cannot interact
* everything needs to be on screen
* large fonts and labels
* how close or far away does it need to be seen?

### WHY

* why share the data? purpose?
* to inform?
* to explore?
* to explain?
* to measure a goal?

#### Types of Dashboards

##### Exploratory: built for **discovery**

* present data to easily find answers
* high levels of interaction
* filters, actions, highlights

##### Informative: built for **information**

* present the data to easily find answers
* still provide some interaction
* more focused on a single question

##### Explanatory: built for **insight**

* presenting the answer to the user
* show the interesting thing we have found
* persuade or make the case to change something

##### Key performance indicator(KPI): built for **attention**

* all about getting someone's attention
* highlighting things of interest
* no filtering, no interaction
* clearly obvious that something is right or wrong

### WHAT

*What question do you want to answer?*

* what information will be showed?
* what question will it answer?
* what do you want the audience to take away?



* what elements will help
* what data do we need to display
* high or low level of detail
* live or extracted data
* how many filters do we need



* what do we need to include
* what should we exclude
* what is the minimum viable information required



**KEEP IT AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE. LESS IS MORE.**





## Tiled vs. Floating

##### Tiled

* grid layout, for standard dashboards
* easy alignment/ rigid structure
* hard to place objects

##### floating

* no grid; place any where
* no snap to grid
* allows for creative freedom
